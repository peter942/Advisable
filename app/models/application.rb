# frozen_string_literal: true

# An application record represents a freelancers (Specialist) association to
# a project. Similar to the Project model, the Application model was one of the
# first models added to the app and has since out grown it's name. Initially
# an application record was createid when a freelancer applied to a project.
# However, now an application record represents a freelancers assoiation to a
# project the entire way throughout the flow, even after they have been hired.
#
# Ideally this record would be broken down into separate models that represent
# different stages of the process of working with a freelancer.
#
# == Statuses
# The state of an application is represented by the 'status' column. This
# was setup to sync with Airtable and so the statuses are not normalied and are
# simply capitalized strings.
#
# [Invited To Apply] Indicates that a freelancer has been invited to apply to
# the project but has not yet applied.
#
# [Applied] When a freelacer has actually applied to a project.
#
# [Invitation Rejected] The freelancer has rejected the invitiation to apply
# to the projet. The reason for the rejection will be set in the
# invitation_rejection_reason collumn.
#
# [Application Rejected] The client has rejected a freelancers application.
# The reason for rejection will be provided in the rejection_reason.
# Feedback for Advisable will be in rejection_feedback.
#
# [Application Accepted] This is the first step of the hiring process. At this
# point the client will have sent an interview request to the freelancer.
#
# [Proposed] The freelancer has sent the client a proposal.
#
# [Working] The freelancer is actively working with the client. Check the
# associated 'tasks' to see the work being done.
#
# [Stopped Working] The freelancer is no longer working with the client. They
# may still resumt working with the freelancer, at which point the status will
# be set back to Working.
