# WebhookEvent's are used to trigger webhooks. The actual event names are hard
# coded and an instance of WebhookEvent configures a webhook to be fired when a
# given event happens.
#
# The following would trigger a webhook to "https://test.com" every time the
# "specialists.application_stage_changed" event was fired.
#
#   WebhookEvent.create(
#     event: "specialists.application_stage_changed",
#     url: "https://test.com"
#   )
#
class WebhookEvent < ApplicationRecord

    # specialists.forgotten_password_for_non_account is triggered when a forgotten
    #Â password email is requested for a specialist who has not yet setup their
    # account.
