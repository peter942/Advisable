# frozen_string_literal: true

# A Specialist specifically represents a specialist account. A client account is
# represented by the User model. Ideally these two models will eventually be
# merged to be different types of users.
#
# A specialist first applys to Advisable before they get an account. This
# application is also tracked in the specialist record. A specialist is
# considered an "account" once a password is set. The status of a specialists
# application is stored in the application_stage column.
#
# == application_stage values
# [Started] They have started a baseic application process but have not yet
# submitted it.
# [On Hold] Their application has been submitted and they are currently on hold
# until we have a project we think is a good fit for them.
# [Full Application] When a freelancer is 'On Hold' they can do what is called
# a 'full application' and upload and validate 3 previous projects to become
# instantly available to clients on Advisable. This status indicates that
# a freelancer has submitted a full application.
# [Accepted] Their application has been successfull.
