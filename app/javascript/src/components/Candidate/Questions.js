        I have developed integrated marketing campaigns utilizing everything
        from social media to television. My expertise lies in digital marketing
        and specifically in marketing automation platforms for email campaigns.
        The budgets and projects have varied from minimal to as high as 6
        million per campaign. Success metrics include both qualitative and
        quantitative values that range from brand perception to increasing sales
        pipeline velocity. In terms of IT services, I have worked with
        telecommunications providers along with many other B2B sectors.
