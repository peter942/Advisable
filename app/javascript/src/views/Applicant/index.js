                I have developed integrated marketing campaigns utilizing
                everything from social media to television. My expertise lies in
                digital marketing and specifically in marketing automation
                platforms for email campaigns. The budgets and projects have
                varied from minimal to as high as 6 million per campaign.
                Success metrics include both qualitative and quantitative values
                that range from brand perception to increasing sales pipeline
                velocity. In terms of IT services, I have worked with
                telecommunications providers along with many other B2B sectors.

                To use the term, campaign, is too narrow. From a strategic POV,
                best practice dictates that a comprehensive Campaign Framework
                should be designed. From this, a structure of programs and
                tactics are developed. Each with a focus on driving the message
                along one of the core strategies. A campaign, as such, is
                actually a program designed to achieve a specific objective of
                the overall campaign. From that point, the structure needs to
                take into account everything from the target audience and
                message to the tactics to reach and communicate with the
                audience. The structure also needs to contain specific
                qualitative and quantitative KPIs along with a delivery
                timeline. When leveraging technology such as MAP, DMP, SRM,
                etc., the best practice is to start simple, keep it easy to
                manage and maintain, and then let data guide the way.
