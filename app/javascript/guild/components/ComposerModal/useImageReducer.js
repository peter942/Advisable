// We manage all of the photos inside of a state reducer. This is to make the UX when managing
// images a little better. e.g Allow users to change cover photos before the photos finish
// uploading. This state is an array of objects with the following attributes:
// - id: The previous project image UID. When a file is uploaded, this is generated on the
//       client side which allows to easily update the graphql cache once the upload completes
//       and the record is saved.
// - url: The url for the image. This will be null for images that are uploading.
// - file: The original file for the image. This will only be set for images that have just been
// .       uploaded and will be null for any images that are returned from the API on initial load.
// - uploading: Whether or not the image is currently uploading.
// - cover: Whether or not the image is the cover photo.
