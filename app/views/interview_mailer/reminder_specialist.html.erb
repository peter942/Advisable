<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick reminder that your call with <%= @user.name %> for your
<%= @interview.application.project.primary_skill %> will take place in

<br/>
<br/>

If you'd like to join via phone, additional details are in the calendar invite
you should've received.
<br/>
<br/>

The goal from this call should be to:
<ol>
  <li>
    Get an in-depth understanding of the project and your requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get an understanding of your capabilities and suitability for the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out the details of how a project with <%= @user.first_name %>
    would work â€“ perhaps an initial paid trial project might make sense.
  </li>
</ol>

After the call, we'll send you an email asking you for feedback - I'd highly
appreciate if you could provide this ASAP.
<br/>

If you have any questions, please let me know.
