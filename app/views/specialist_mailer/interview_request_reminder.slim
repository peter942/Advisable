p Hi #{@interview.specialist.account.first_name},

p This is a reminder to respond to the meeting request from  #{@interview.user.company.name.presence || @interview.user.account.name}, who would like to discuss a potential project with you.

p This is a great opportunity for you to understand their requirements and figure out how you can work together.

p As a reminder, #{@interview.user.name_with_company} left the following message:

p "#{@message.content}"

p You can accept or decline their request <a clicktracking=off href="#{magic_link(@interview.specialist.account, interview_request_url(@message.conversation))}">here</a>.

p If this project is not a good fit for you, ensure you still decline the request. If you don't respond within the next 2 days it will be automatically declined. This could negatively affect your case study ranking and the chances of you being recommended in the future.

p
  ' Best,
