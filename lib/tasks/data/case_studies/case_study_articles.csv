"407","csa_YlzltXrZ2R0K91f","50","t","Magic Media - Video Production","Magic Media were looking for an agency to create videos for their website and social media. The videos would be used to promote their services to their clients. Magic Media have created and purchased a number of subsidiary companies to provide a wide span of services related to the games and entertainment industry such as full-cycle game development, game and cinematics animation, software development, and cybersecurity.

Previous to working with us, they had been working briefly with a company in Belgium but they only had one video created with them (it was shared as a reference during their initial enquiry) and were looking for an agency in Ireland to create multiple videos over the coming months. The reason for choosing Ireland was they have an office in Dublin and their marketing manager is stationed in Dublin also.

The first video we created for them was to promote once of their services which was Penetration Testing (https://vimeo.com/528250523). Penetration Testing is anything to do with security issues for video games online. So, basically to protect against hackers. And I did another one for load testing, which is basically to allow them to handle heavy traffic for video games online. So, if there are a million players online, it means that the servers can handle that traffic.

From there we created multiple videos for other services, videos to promote their webinars and also a showreel:

The reason for choosing Ireland was they have an office in Dublin and their marketing manager is stationed in Dublin also.\n\nThe first video we created for them was to promote once of their services which was Penetration Testing (https://vimeo.com/528250523). Penetration Testing is anything to do with security issues for video games online. So, basically to protect against hackers.
