    ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

    # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
    # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
    # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!

    # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
    #
    # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
    throttle("req/ip", limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
      # prevent static assets from counting towards the rate limit
      req.ip unless req.path.start_with?("/assets") || req.path.start_with?("/packs")
    end
